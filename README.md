# Dmitrii Gorlov – Data Scientist | Recommender Systems & Applied ML

Hey there! 👋  
I’m Dmitrii — a curious human who accidentally fell in love with data and never looked back.

For over 10 years, I’ve been helping businesses make smarter decisions — first through digital marketing and analytics, and now through machine learning and product-focused data science.

I’m especially passionate about:
- 🤖 Recommender systems & personalization
- 📈 Applied ML for user behavior, forecasting, and business KPIs
- ⚙️ Building fast, interpretable, and resource-efficient solutions

I enjoy digging deep into problems, spotting patterns, and shipping things that work — even if they’re not flashy. I believe the best models are the ones that make it into production *and* make sense to the people using them.

## 🧪 Side Projects

> I enjoy creating lightweight prototypes that explore data, behavior, and UX. Some are serious. Some are fun. Some are both.

## 🧭 Beyond Data

I’m fascinated by the intersection of technology and human behavior — especially where data meets psychology, product design, and real-world messiness. Also active in communities around **authentic relating**, **ethnosocial tourism**, and **behavioral science**.
