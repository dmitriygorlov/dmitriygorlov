# Dmitrii Gorlov ‚Äì Data Scientist | Recommender Systems & Applied ML

Hi! I‚Äôm Dmitrii ‚Äî a data scientist with 10+ years of experience across digital marketing, analytics, and machine learning. I specialize in solving practical business problems with data, focusing on fast, efficient solutions that deliver value without unnecessary complexity.

My current interests include:
- **Recommender systems** (collaborative filtering, cold start, hybrid approaches)
- **Applied ML** for user behavior, retention, and forecasting
- **Building lightweight, interpretable solutions** that work well under real-world constraints

I value clarity, practicality, and speed in development. I'm especially effective on projects that connect business/product logic with analytical rigor ‚Äî often in web, e-commerce, or behavioral domains.

## üì¶ Selected Experience

- Designing **end-to-end recommendation pipelines** (from offline batch scoring to Redis-based delivery)
- Developing **forecasting and classification models** for user and product behavior
- Building and optimizing **data pipelines** (ETL from scratch, legacy optimization)
- Applying **time series analysis**, **LLMs**, and experimentation frameworks in production

## ü§ù Interests & Collaboration

Beyond work, I‚Äôm interested in behavioral psychology, ethnosocial tourism, and how human behavior interacts with systems and data. I enjoy building tools and prototypes that explore these intersections.

Feel free to reach out for collaboration or just to chat about data, RecSys, or ideas.
