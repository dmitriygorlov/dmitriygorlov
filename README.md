Aloha!

My name is Dmitrii Gorlov and I'm <strike>data-alcoholic</strike> Data Lover :)

For 8 years I have been working in Digital Marketing (from strategies and department management to landing pages and conferences). 

One day I woke up and realized that I love data and I like to tinker with it and do cool stuff. 

I develop in Data Science in order to implement business efficient and non-commercial projects at the intersection of sociology/psychology and ML/AI. **I am most valuable in web/e-commerce projects.**

Now I work as a `Data Scientist` at [Ticketland.ru](https://www.ticketland.ru/). I am engaged in recommender systems, classifiers and predictions, as well as reports.
