Aloha!

My name is Dmitrii Gorlov and I'm <strike>data-alcoholic</strike> Data Lover :)

For 8 years I have been working in Digital Marketing (from strategies and department management to landing pages and conferences). 

One day I woke up and realized that I love data and I like to play with it and do cool stuff. 

I am developing my skills in Data Science to implement business-oriented and non-commercial projects at the intersection of sociology/psychology and ML/AI. **I am most valuable in web/e-commerce projects.**

My experience includes:

- Building ETL from scratch and optimizing legacy.
- Developing recommendation systems, classifiers, and predictions.
- Time series analysis and LLM application.
- Working on projects that do not require large computing resources.

I appreciate tasks where I can apply my knowledge and experience without resorting to "heavy" neural networks.
